# My Saber Site

Saber is a static website generator for building blazing fast, modern websites with Vue.js.

You can start by populating some `.vue` or `.md` files in the `./pages` folder, and they will automatically become web pages, like this file.

## Using Layouts

Layouts are Vue components that wrap around your page. They allow you to have the source code for your template in one place so you donâ€™t have to repeat things like your navigation and footer on every page.

You can use page attributes to set layout, in a Markdown page, page attributes are represented as front matter:

```markdown
---
layout: page
---

This page uses the `page` layout.
```

Check out the [About](./about.md) page which uses the `page` layout.
